## 2.3.0 cycle

- [LW-16] SHIPPED 58d5c7b 2026-07-05: long item descriptions pushed the equip card off the
  screen (Sanguine Sword id 23, owner screenshot). Fixed with the analyze.py total-description
  budget (DESC_MAX=259, live-calibrated) plus three owner-approved prose trims (Sanguine Sword,
  Wrathblade, Stormarc).
- [LW-17] SHIPPED f4bf5df 2026-07-05: stale-latch kill mis-credit under auto-battle AND manual
  play (root-caused from flight archives; the Ember Rod / Claymore mis-credit adjudicated on
  tape). Fixed with the KillerStamp death-edge culprit stamp; live-verified the same day (4
  correct stamp overrides on tape, including the battle-ending Queklain credit under
  auto-battle). The residual turn-count half is tracked as LW-7.
- [LW-18] SHIPPED a3106d0 2026-07-05: BuildLinked deploys wiped the flight/ archives (PowerShell
  Remove-Item with -Exclude filtering is unreliable and erased the auto-battle attribution
  tape). Fixed with the named temp-dir preservation round-trip ($PreservedSaveFiles in
  tools/pipeline.ps1); all three manual verifications passed live.
- [LW-19] RETRACTED 2026-07-05: "battle-ENDING kills vanish" was a false alarm (the suspect
  tape was a manual RETRY of Lionel Gate, not a victory; the completed re-run credited all
  seven deaths cleanly). Kept findings live in LIVE_LEDGER and the Reliquary docs:
  per-encounter canonical boss keys, retry re-earns tally kills, and the Queklain
  battle-ending credit through its cutscene.
